# ng-follow-menu-component
Angular 4 follow along menu component

Inspired by Wes Bos' free Javascript30 course, this is an Angular 4 implementation of the follow-along menu built in his "Stripe Follow Along Nav" project.

The elements with the "dropdown" class can be populated with whatever you'd like, and the background will "follow" the dropdown that is currently open via mouse events.
